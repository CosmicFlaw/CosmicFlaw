- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CosmicFlaw
- Iâ€™m interested in GameDev and Webdev (almost anything that has some form of programming involved in it)
  - For Gamedev, I use Godot with GDScript.
  - For Webdev, I use HTML and CSS (currently learning JS)
  - For Data Science and AI Projects, I use Python (jupyter)
  - Plus, I also know the basics of C and C++ and also basic Arduino Programming

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing, I am learning most of things currently but still, I 'can' collaborate on some game jams and AI projects....... (thanks for the help, anyway)
- How to reach me:
  - I go by the same name on StackOverflow, Discord, Itch.io, also a member of AISC community.
    
- This was all about me, Thanks! Want to collaborate or just chat, reach out to me!
