- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CosmicFlaw
- Iâ€™m interested in GameDev and Webdev (almost anything that has some form of programming involved in it)
  1. For Gamedev, I use Godot with GDScript.
  2. For Webdev, I use HTML and CSS (currently learning JS)
  3. For Data Science and AI Projects, I use Python (jupyter)
  4. Plus, I also know the basics of C and C++ and also basic Arduino Programming

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing, I am learning most of things currently but still, I 'may' collaborate on some game jams and AI projects..... (thanks for the help, anyway)
  
- How to reach me:
  I go by the same username on StackOverflow, Discord, Itch.io, also a member of AISC community.

- Apart from programming stuff, I also have a deep rooted interest in Pure Maths and Astronomy.

- This was all about me! Want to collaborate or just chat, reach out to me!
- Thanks!
